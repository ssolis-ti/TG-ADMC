# Index 0: THE CODEX (The Driver)

> _"Vision without execution is hallucination. Execution without vision is chaos."_

## ⚠️ MANDATORY READING FOR ALL SYSTEMS

**Status**: ACTIVE DRIVER
**Priority**: CRITICAL (Override Level 0)

## 1. The Prime Directive: "The Winning MVP"

We are not building a cathedral; we are building a **High-Performance Speedboat**.

- **Speed > Perfection**: Shipping a working product beats a perfect architecture diagram.
- **Impact > Features**: Every line of code must directly contribute to the User's ability to _Create_, _Pay_, or _Verify_ a deal.
- **Zero Fluff**: If it doesn't move value, **delete it**.

## 2. The Mental Model: "Web3 Pragmatism"

We operate at the intersection of two worlds. We must be the bridge, not the barrier.

- **Be The Translator**: The user doesn't care about "NanoTON" or "BOCs". They care about "Paid". Hide the complexity.
- **Trust via Transparency**: Since we are Centralized (for now), we must be brutally honest in our logs and UI. The logs act as our "Paper Trail".

## 3. The Constraints (Our Strength)

- **No Smart Contracts (Yet)**: Use the Python Backend as a fast, flexible prototype of the future contract logic.
- **Vanilla JS**: Use the lightweight nature of the web platform to deliver instant load times inside Telegram. No heavy frameworks.
- **Testnet First**: Break things where money is free. Perfect the flow before real capital is at risk.

## 4. The Definition of Success

The system is considered "Ready" when:

1.  A stranger can open the bot.
2.  Connect their wallet.
3.  Pay for an ad.
4.  See the result.
    **...Without reading a manual.**
